# InstaEngine
Custom C++ Game Engine using SDL2

## Why?
Im making this for two main reasons:

### Practice
Last semester, I made my own custom engine in Java to practice the skills I learned over the semester. Now that I am taking a C++ class, I wanted to do the same thing again,
this time with the intention of actually using this engine once its finished to fully develop and publish a game

### Portfolio
Looking for internships is hard, so I want a nice portfolio to stand out. This project will show my proficiency with C++ and game development at the same time!
